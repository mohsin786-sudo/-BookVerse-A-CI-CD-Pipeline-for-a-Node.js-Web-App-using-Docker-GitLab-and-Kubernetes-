# 📚 BookVerse: A CI/CD Pipeline for a Node.js Web App

This project demonstrates a full DevOps pipeline for a simple Node.js web application using **Docker**, **GitLab CI/CD**, and **Kubernetes**. It automates building, testing, containerizing, and deploying the app to a Kubernetes cluster.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Node.js** – Backend runtime environment
- **Docker** – Containerization
- **GitLab CI/CD** – Continuous Integration and Deployment
- **Kubernetes** – Container orchestration
- **YAML** – For CI/CD and K8s configurations

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/your-username/bookverse-ci-cd.git
cd bookverse-ci-cd

2. Install Dependencies

npm install

3. Run Locally

node app.js

The app will run on http://localhost:3000


---

🐳 Docker Setup

Build Docker Image

docker build -t bookverse-app .

Run Container

docker run -p 3000:3000 bookverse-app


---

🔁 GitLab CI/CD Pipeline

The .gitlab-ci.yml defines pipeline stages:

build: Build Docker image

test: Run app tests (if implemented)

deploy: Deploy to Kubernetes


Pipeline triggers automatically on every push to the repository.


---

☸️ Kubernetes Deployment

Apply Kubernetes manifests from the k8s/ directory:

kubectl apply -f k8s/

Check deployment status:

kubectl get pods
kubectl get services
